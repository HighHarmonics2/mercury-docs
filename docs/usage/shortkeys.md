# ðŸ©³ Short-keys

Mercury has various shortkeys that help you navigate the editor more quickly during live performances, both in the Mercury4Max as in the MercuryPlayground versions. 

:::warning Known issue
`alt + /` for non UK/US keyboards can be an issue, because the `/` is not a unique key but above the `7` so you need to use `shift`. This seems to not work in the browser editor
:::

:::info External Editor
When you use an external editor like Pulsar the `Overall Shortkeys` apply, but all other shortkeys for navigating and editting are based on the preferences of that editor.
:::

If you encounter any other issues please file a report via the steps in [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting).
