# ðŸ“¦ Add Mercury in your Site

It is also possible to include Mercury in your own website. This is done with the [`mercury-engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mercury-engine). The engine is available as a package on npmjs.com or via unpkg.com.


## Examples

For examples of the Engine used in `.html` pages please [download the repository from github](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-engine). 

- Navigate to the folder `cd mercury-engine`
- Start a localhost server with for example by running `npx http-server` ([install http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server))
- Go to `http://localhost:8080` (or whichever port is assigned by the http-server) and got to `examples/`.

## Install

### Install in node_modules

```
$ npm install mercury-engine
```

```js
const { Mercury } = require('mercury-engine');

const Engine = new Mercury();
```

### Include in html

Include latest or a specific version of distribution (minified, es5) through url in script index.html 

Recommended for most cases:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine/dist/mercury.min.es5.js"></script>
```

Other options:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine/dist/mercury.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine@1.0.0/dist/mercury.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine@1.0.0/dist/mercury.min.es5.js"></script>
```

Load the engine in the `<script>` code like so:

```js
const { Mercury } = MercuryEngine;

const Engine = new Mercury();
```

### Examples

See the `examples` folder for a few `.html` files that demonstrate the usage. Run them locally by cloning this repository with `git clone https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-engine`. Then `cd mercury-engine` and run a simple http-server, for example with the `http-server` node package (install globally with `npm i -g http-server`). Navigate to `localhost:8080/examples` and try them out.

## Usage

#### Include and initialize

Include the package

```js
const { Mercury } = require('mercury-engine');
```

Initialize the engine and include a callback function through `{ onload: }`, this will be executed when samples are loaded.

```js
const Engine = Mercury({
	onload: () => {
		console.log('This callback is called when samples are loaded!');
		console.log('The loaded samples:', Engine.getBuffers());
	}
});
```

#### Resume, evaluate and silence

Resume the transport and start the webaudio. This has to be done from a user interaction (click or keypress) to allow sound to play from the browser window.

```js
Engine.resume();
```

Evaluate a mercury code file by providing a string of code. This also resumes the transport if .resume() was not called yet.

```js
Engine.code(`
	set tempo 100
	new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
	new sample hat_909 time(1/4 1/8) gain(0.6)
	new synth saw note(0 0) time(1/16) shape(1 80)
`);
```

Stop the transport and silence the audio

```js
Engine.silence();
```

Return the last succesfully evaluated code. If code is evaluated that resulted in an error it is not stored.

```js
Engine.getCode();
```

#### Samples

Add your own samples from for example a url like raw github or freesound. The url can also contain a .json file that references multiple samples and the sample name.

```js
Engine.addBuffers(files, callback);
```

For example use a json file containing sample names and urls

```js
Engine.addBuffers('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmhglnd/mercury-engine/main/examples/samples/freesound-samples.json');
```

Or load samples directly by creating an array of urls

```js
let s1 = 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/671/671221_3797507-lq.mp3';
let s2 = 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/145/145778_2101444-lq.mp3';

Engine.addBuffers([s1, s2]);
```

Add a callback function, this is called when all samples are loaded

```js
Engine.addBuffers('https://someurl.json', () => {
	console.log('This callback is called when samples are loaded!');
	console.log('The loaded samples:', Engine.getBuffers());
});
```

Get the content of all the loaded Buffers, this is returned as a `ToneAudioBuffers` class

```js
Engine.getBuffers();
```

#### Recording

Start the recording of the sound

```js
Engine.record(true);
```

Returns 'started' if the recording is on

```js
Engine.isRecording();
```

Stop the recording and download the file `myRecording.webm`

```js
Engine.record(false, 'myRecording');
```

#### Meter

You can add a meter to the main audio output and poll for the amplitude value from the meter to for example create audio-reactive visuals in other programming languages such as Hydra or P5.js.

First add the meter, optionally with a smoothing factor (default=0.7)

```js
Engine.addMeter();
```

Get the meter value as floating-point between 0-1

```js
Engine.getMeter();
```

Store the meters amplitude value in a global variable for usage in other places and update regularly with a setInterval at a defined interval in milliseconds.

```js
let amp;

setInterval(() => amp = Engine.getMeter(), 100);
```

For example control some visual parameter in [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz)

```js
osc(10, 0.2, () => amp * 20).out();
```

#### MIDI

WebMIDI is included and started if the browser is compatible with it. If not, an error will be printed to the console. You can provide a callback function `onmidi` to execute some code when the WebMIDI enabling was succesful.

```js
const Engine = Mercury({
	onmidi: () => {
		console.log('The WebMIDI status is:', Engine.midi.status);
		console.log('With inputs:', Engine.midi.inputs);
		console.log('And outputs:', Engine.midi.outputs);
	}
});
```

#### Settings

Set the BPM without using `set tempo` in the Mercury code

```js
Engine.setBPM(140);
```

Set a randomized BPM

```js
Engine.randomBPM();
```

Set the volume without using `set volume` in the Mercury code. Volume in floating amplitude 0 to 1.

```js
Engine.setVolume(0.5);
```

Set the crossFade between 2 code evaluations without using `set crossFade` in the Mercury code. Time in milliseconds.

```js
Engine.setCrossFade(500);
```

Set the HighPass Filter cutoff frequency without using `set highPass` in the Mercury code.

```js
Engine.setHighPass(400);
```

Set the LowPass Filter cutoff frequency without using `set lowPass` in the Mercury code.

```js
Engine.setLowPass(5000);
```

Get the value for any of the settings

```js
console.log(Engine.bpm);
console.log(Engine.volume);
console.log(Engine.crossFade);
console.log(Engine.highPass);
console.log(Engine.lowPass);
```

#### Log function listener

Logs that are important for the Mercury coder are also emitted as a custom event in the browser. You can create an event listener for `mercuryLog`. The `e.detail` contains the printed message. This can be used to for example print things to custom html elements instead of the javascript console.

```js
window.addEventListener('mercuryLog', (e) => {
	let p = JSON.stringify(e.detail).replace(/\,/g, ' ').replace(/\"/g, '');
	document.getElementById('logger').innerHTML += `${p}<br>`;
	console.log('customprint:', e.detail);
});
```

#### DOM elements from P5js

It is possible to control parameters from instruments in the Mercury code by writing a string that contains `{}` with the js code inside to get the dom value. For example when using DOM elements from the P5js library, such as sliders, they can be used in the code.

```js
let slider;

// p5js setup function
function setup() {
	noCanvas();
	// create a slider with range 50 - 5000, initial 1000
	slider = createSlider(50, 5000, 1000, 0);
}

// use the slider value as a cutoff frequency for the filter
Engine.code(`new synth saw note(0 0) fx(filter low '{slider.value()}' 0.4)`);
```
