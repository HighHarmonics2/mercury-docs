# ðŸ”­ What does Mercury for you?

Are you not sure if Mercury is for you? Maybe after reading this you have a better idea if so:

---

- Giving you a quick and hands-on coding environment/language to express, communicate and improvise livecoded works.

- Giving you an environment to learn and/or teach:

	- Introduction to (electronic) music

	- Algorithmic composition techniques

	- Sequencing and pattern generating

	- Sound design

	- Creative coding and live coding

- Giving you a hands-on language to control realtime processes

	- Code sound and music

	- Code visuals and let them react to sound

	- Control external processes of other software and hardware

- Giving you an extensive library of algorithmic composition techniques

	- Released as a seperate package titled [total-serialism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/total-serialism)

- Giving you a multi-purpose non-linear-sequencer 

	- use OSC-messages to communicate with other platforms

	- use MIDI-messages to communicate with other platforms and devices

- Giving you a quick-to-use sampler/synthesizer for sounddesign and composing

	- use external OSC-messages to control parameters in the samplers/synthesizers

	- use external MIDI devices and messages to play the sampler/synthesizers (coming soon...)

- Allowing you to run the software directly in the browser

- Allowing you to collaborate in Mercury via the browser with Flok to code music together

- Allowing you to join the Mercury users-community of live coding enthousiasts that can help you with your journey
